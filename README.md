# sh8-borrow-pits

This repository is to share unrestricted "SH8 borrow pit" data to the following stakeholders:
* Waka Kotahi
* Downer NZ
* ECan
* Stantec NZ

Images in the images directory are numbered by Pit ID, which is numbered like the Waka Kotahi Bridge Management System, i.e. (RS + RP(km to 1 decimal place)) x 10.
e.g. A pit on RS 169 at 4.3km would have an ID of (169 + 4.3) x 10 = **1733**

Image suffixes are the imagery source:
* linz = Canterbury 0.4m Rural Aerial Photos (2013-2014) sourced from the LINZ Data Service: https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/52117-canterbury-04m-rural-aerial-photos-2013-2014/
* esri = ESRI World Imagery sourced directly from ESRI: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9

If you wish to amend data, please email peter.hill@stantec.com OR clone and create a PR.
